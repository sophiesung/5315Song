      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization as known as containerization. It used as a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. </p>
      <p>In a way, Docker is a bit like a virtual machine.But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.</p>
      <p>And importantly, Docker is open source. This means that anyone can contribute to Docker and extend it to meet their own needs if they need additional features that aren't available out of the box.</p>

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>Nginx is a web server which can be used as a server proxy, load balancer and HTTP cache. It can be deployed to serve dynamix HTTP content on the network using FastCGI, SCGI handlers for scripts, WSGI application servers or Phusion Passenger modules, and can serve as a software load balancer. Moreover, Nginx uses an asynchronous event-driven approach to handling requests.</p>
      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. In other words, creating a computer within a computer. It runs in a window, much like any other program, giving the end user the same experience on a virtual machine as they would have on the host operating system itself. The virtual machine is sandboxed from the rest of the system, meaning that the software inside a virtual machine can’t escape or tamper with the computer itself. This produces an ideal environment for testing other operating systems including beta releases, accessing virus-infected data, creating operating system backups, and running software or applications on operating systems they weren’t originally intended for.</p>
      <p>Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.</p>
      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean is a cloud infrastructure provider headquartered in New York City with data centers worldwide. It provides developers cloud services that help to deploy and scale applications that run simultaneously on multiple computers.</p>
      <p> DigitalOcean has some really powerful servers. When running the appropriate software on the server you can create Virtual Private Servers (also known as Droplets or Containers). The VPS is a virtual machine, which utilizes part of the server resources (CPU, RAM, HDD) and runs its own copy of the operating system and provides superuser (root) access to DigitalOcean`s clients. This means that each client can have his own Droplet, running a chosen Operating system. The client has administrator (root) access to the VPS, so he can make changes without conforming with the other users, which have their Droplets on the same DigitalOcean server.</p>
