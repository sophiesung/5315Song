      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization as known as containerization. It used as a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. 
      <h2>In a way, Docker is a bit like a virtual machine.But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.</h2>
      <h2>And importantly, Docker is open source. This means that anyone can contribute to Docker and extend it to meet their own needs if they need additional features that aren't available out of the box.</h2> </p>
